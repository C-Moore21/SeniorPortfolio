# Senior Portfolio

## [Chatroom](https://github.com/C-Moore21/SeniorPortfolio/tree/master/Chatroom)

I chose this assignment because this was the first time I had not only created a protocol but used it on a low level. This assignment taught a lot about the techniques of software design on a protocol level and where you can easily go wrong. Working as a group split off into pairs helped show where we had gone wrong as a group creating the protocol because upon final testing in the course within our groups it became known that our implementations of the protocol did not always work as they should have due to minor differences which could have been ironed out in the protocol if it was designed better.

## [Webserver](https://github.com/C-Moore21/SeniorPortfolio/tree/master/webserver)

I chose this assignment because it is one of the assignments that exemplified attaining a system-level understand of the computer. This assignment did this by teaching me HOW a webserver and a client interact with each other. This also taught me about how to multithread a server to handle multiple clients at a single time.

## [Sleeping TA](https://github.com/C-Moore21/SeniorPortfolio/tree/master/sleepingta/src)

I chose this assignment because it was one of the key assignments in helping me develop a deeper system-level understanding of the computer. This came from the nature of the assignment being the use of threading and mutex locking. These concepts were foreign to me - and even during explanation in the course left some mystery. After struggling through the assignment and eventually completing it I finally understood threading (and how to use it on a basic level) as well as mutex locking.

## [Peg Solitaire](https://github.com/C-Moore21/SeniorPortfolio/tree/master/peg_solitare)

I chose this assignment because it was an assignment which required critical thinking to not only solve the problem at hand but understand how the problem was orchestrated and how to represent it programmatically. It also deepened my understanding of recursive functions to solve problems.

## [Database Project](https://github.com/C-Moore21/SeniorPortfolio/tree/master/db_project/HopToIt-master)

I chose this project because in my time at Westminster College it is the defacto collaborative project work experience. Throughout the course of this project we worked together as a group of four collaboratively using a version control system to manage commits. In the end as a group we got 100% on the project and all felt successful as a group.
